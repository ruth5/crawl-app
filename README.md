# Crawl Overview
Crawl is a web app that seamlessly plans food and bar crawls for its users. Using the nearest neighbor algorithm, the app generates an optimized order of crawl stops to minimize backtracking. To build the app, I designed and created a PostreSQL database; built a backend server using Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy; and rendered the frontend with Jinja and JavaScript. I integrated the Google Places and Geocoding APIs to find places based on user-submitted crawl criteria. I also incorporated Google Directions and Maps APIs to show a map and directions for the optimized crawl routes.
